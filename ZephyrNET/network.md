# setup

1. login to unifi.ui.com
2. go to the Network application for the router
3. go to the LAN network in the settings and set the LAN CIDR to `10.101.8.1/16`
4. reboot all the access points.
5. reboot the router.


P.S. Step #3 knocks two access points offline :/. We will have to fix this. They are disabled for now.
